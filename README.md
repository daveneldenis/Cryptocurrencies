# Cryptocurrencies

## Objectives
The goals for this challenge are for you to:

Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

## Accountability Accounting Presentation
### Background
Accountability Accounting a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the immense universe of cryptocurrencies and asks you to present a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing this new investment product.

### Presentation
3D scatter plot using Plotly Express to plot the clusters. We were able to identify 3 Clusters.

Data table with all the current tradable cryptocurrencies. This table provides a comprehensive list of cryptocurrencies for the investment portfolio.

Scatter plot to present the clustered data about cryptocurrencies to contrast the number of available coins versus the total number of mined coins. A great visual to depict TotalCoinSupply and TotalCoinsMined by class.
